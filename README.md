## A Scientific Calculator App

I started this project after seeing a sample of the scientific calculator in one of the tutorial I watched but decided not to use the same code from the video because I want to be able to come up with my own logics, so as to get better in logical thinking when it comes to javascript but i got stuck trying to implement the scientific functions in the calculator.

Below is an image of the calculator, and more images is in the images folder in this repository;

On click of the f1, f2, or f3 buttons, the operator buttons below is supposed to change in respect to the various functions assigned to the them in the onclick function.

I've checked online, but couldn't get a good logic to help me through it, I would love a logical thought of someone who has gone a lot more farther in javascript than I have, to probably just look at it and help me with a logical idea of how to get through it. Thanks.
